abstract="This chapter surveys some of the principal research trends in social robotics and its application to human--robot interaction                 human--robot interaction (HRI)              (HRI). Social (or sociable) robots are designed to interact with people in anatural, interpersonal manner -- often to achieve social-emotional goals in diverse applications such as education, health, quality of life, entertainment, communication, and collaboration. The long-term goal of creating social robots that are competent and capable partners for people is quite achallenging task. They will need to be able to communicate naturally with people using both verbal and nonverbal signals. They will need to engage us not only on acognitive level, but on an emotional level as well. They will need awide range of social-cognitive skills and atheory of other minds to understand human behavior, and to be intuitively understood by people. Adeep understanding of human intelligence and behavior across multiple dimensions (i.e., cognitive, affective, physical, social, etc.) is necessary in order to design robots that can successfully play abeneficial role in the daily lives of people. This requires amultidisciplinary approach where the design of social robot technologies and methodologies are informed by robotics, artificial intelligence, psychology, neuroscience, human factors, design, anthropology, and more.

pages="157--181",
abstract="This article presents a review of the contemporary robotics research with respect to making robots and human--robot interaction (HRI) useful for autism intervention in clinical settings. Robotics research over the past decade has demonstrated that many children with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) have a strong interest in robots and robot toys and can connect with a robot significantly better than with a human. Despite showing great promise, research in this direction has made minimal progress in advancing robots as clinically useful for ASD intervention. Moreover, the clinicians are generally not convinced about the potential of robots. A major reason behind this is that a vast majority of HRI studies on robot-mediated intervention (RMI) do not follow any standard research design and, consequently, the data produced by these studies is minimally appealing to the clinical community. In clinical research on ASD intervention, a systematic evaluation of the evidence found from a study is performed to determine the effectiveness of an experimental intervention (e.g., a RMI). An intervention that produces a stable positive effect is considered as an evidence-based practice (EBP) in autism. EBPs enable clinicians to choose the best available treatments for an individual with ASD. The ultimate goal of RMI, therefore, is to be considered as an EBP so that they can actually be used for treating autism. There are several criteria to measure the strength of evidence, and they are mostly geared toward rigorous research design. The research on RMI, therefore, needs to follow standard research design to be acceptable by the clinical community. This paper reviews the contemporary literature on robotics and autism to understand the status of RMI with respect to being an EBP in autism treatment. First, a set of guidelines is reported which is considered as a benchmark for research design in clinical research on ASD intervention and can easily be adopted in HRI studies on RMI. The existing literature on RMI is then reviewed with respect to these guidelines. We hope that the guidelines reported in this paper will help the robotics community to design user studies on RMI that meet clinical standards and thereby produce results that can lead RMI toward being considered as an EBP in autism. Note that the paper is exclusively focused on the role of robots in ASD intervention/therapy. Reviews on the use of robots in ASD diagnosis are beyond the scope of this paper.",
